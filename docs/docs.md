# CLI

Build website files and watch for chages:

`gulp dev-advanced`

(It is not advanced at all, but I had a more primitive "dev" version.)

Pack all static files into the "build" folder, ready for production:

`gulp prod`

# TODO

- Make website mobile friendly
- Create production gulp task
- Make navigation interactive
- Ensure height is handled properly
- Add link to website github source code
- Rename devAdvanced to dev
