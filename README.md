# RibaricPlusPlus

This is the source code for my personal website: https://ribaricplusplus.github.io/

It does not use any fancy styling frameworks, templating engines, or other such things.
I wanted to keep it as low level as possible. Though I did opt to use React because
that does not restrict customisability in any way.
